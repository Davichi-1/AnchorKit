# Design Document: Tracing Span Validation

## Overview

This design specifies comprehensive test coverage for the existing tracing span and request ID functionality in the AnchorKit smart contract. The system already implements request ID generation (`generate_request_id(env) -> RequestId`), tracing span storage via persistent storage, and retrieval (`get_tracing_span(env, request_id_bytes) -> Option<TracingSpan>`). This feature adds systematic validation to ensure these mechanisms work correctly across all operations, edge cases, and failure scenarios.

The validation framework will use property-based testing to verify universal correctness properties and unit tests for specific examples and edge cases. All tests will be implemented using the Soroban SDK's built-in testing utilities.

## Architecture

The validation system consists of three main components:

1. **Request ID Validation**: Tests for request ID generation, uniqueness, and timestamp accuracy
2. **Span Metadata Validation**: Tests for completeness and accuracy of tracing span fields
3. **Integration Validation**: Tests for request ID propagation through operations and span storage/retrieval

The testing approach follows a layered strategy:
- Unit tests validate individual components and specific scenarios
- Property-based tests validate universal properties across randomized inputs
- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows

## Components and Interfaces

### Request ID Generator Tests

Tests the `generate_request_id(env)` contract method to ensure:
- Correct byte length (16 bytes)
- Uniqueness across multiple generations
- Accurate timestamp capture
- Deterministic behavior based on ledger state

### Tracing Span Validator Tests

Tests the `TracingSpan` structure and tracing span persistent storage to ensure:
- Complete metadata capture (request_id, operation, actor, timestamps, status)
- Accurate timing information
- Correct status values
- Proper storage and retrieval via `get_tracing_span(env, request_id_bytes)`

### Operation Integration Tests

Tests contract methods that use request IDs:
- `submit_with_request_id`: Attestation submission with tracing
- `quote_with_request_id`: Quote submission with tracing
- `get_tracing_span`: Span retrieval by request ID


## Data Models

### Test Data Structures

```rust
// Test helper for generating random valid attestations
struct TestAttestation {
    issuer: Address,
    subject: Address,
    timestamp: u64,
    payload_hash: BytesN<32>,
    signature: Bytes,
}

// Test helper for generating random valid quotes
struct TestQuote {
    anchor: Address,
    base_asset: String,
    quote_asset: String,
    rate: u64,
    fee_percentage: u32,
    minimum_amount: u64,
    maximum_amount: u64,
    valid_until: u64,
}

// Test helper for span validation
struct SpanAssertion {
    expected_request_id: BytesN<16>,
    expected_operation: String,
    expected_actor: Address,
    expected_status: String,
}
```

### Existing Data Models (from implementation)

```rust
pub struct RequestId {
    pub id: BytesN<16>,
    pub created_at: u64,
}

pub struct TracingSpan {
    pub request_id: RequestId,
    pub operation: String,
    pub actor: Address,
    pub started_at: u64,
    pub completed_at: u64,
    pub status: String,
}
```


## Correctness Properties

A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.

### Request ID Generation Properties

Property 1: Request ID Length Invariant
*For any* generated request ID, the ID field must be exactly 16 bytes in length.
**Validates: Requirements 1.1**

Property 2: Request ID Uniqueness
*For any* sequence of request ID generations with changing ledger state, all generated IDs must be unique.
**Validates: Requirements 1.2**

Property 3: Timestamp Positivity
*For any* generated request ID, the created_at timestamp must be greater than zero.
**Validates: Requirements 1.3**

### Storage and Retrieval Properties

Property 12: Span Storage Round-Trip
*For any* tracing span stored with a request ID, retrieving by that request ID must return an equivalent span.

**Validates: Requirements 5.3**

Property 19: Failure Span Creation
*For any* operation that fails, a tracing span must still be created and retrievable.
**Validates: Requirements 5.4**

### Actor and Status Properties

*For any* operation that succeeds without tracing, the same operation with tracing must also succeed and return the same result.
**Validates: Requirements 10.1, 10.2**

## Error Handling

The validation tests will handle the following error scenarios:

1. **Invalid Request IDs**: Tests will verify behavior when querying non-existent request IDs
2. **Failed Operations**: Tests will verify spans are created even when operations fail
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Tests will verify actor recording when operations are rejected
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Tests will verify span storage handles multiple operations correctly

Error handling validation will use both positive tests (operations that should succeed) and negative tests (operations that should fail with specific errors).

## Testing Strategy

### Dual Testing Approach

The validation will use both unit tests and property-based tests:

- **Unit tests**: Verify specific examples, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Property tests**: Verify universal properties across randomized inputs

Both types of tests are complementary and necessary for comprehensive coverage. Unit tests catch concrete bugs in specific scenarios, while property tests verify general correctness across many inputs.

### Property-Based Testing Configuration

- **Framework**: Soroban SDK's built-in testing utilities with custom property test helpers
- **Iterations**: Minimum 100 iterations per property test (due to randomization)
- **Test Tagging**: Each property test must reference its design document property
- **Tag Format**: `// Feature: tracing-span-validation, Property {number}: {property_text}`


### Test Organization

Tests will be organized into modules:

1. **request_id_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 1-4 (request ID generation)
2. **span_metadata_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 5-11 (span metadata)
3. **span_storage_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 12-15 (storage/retrieval)
4. **operation_coverage_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 16-19 (operation types)
5. **actor_status_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 20-22 (actor and status)
6. **timing_validation_tests.rs**: Properties 23-24 (timing accuracy)
7. **integration_validation_tests.rs**: Property 25 (non-interference)

### Unit Test Strategy

Unit tests will focus on:
- Specific examples demonstrating correct behavior
- Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, concurrent operations)
- Error conditions (unauthorized access, invalid inputs)
- Integration points between tracing and existing operations

### Property Test Strategy

Property tests will focus on:
- Universal invariants (length, uniqueness, timing constraints)
- Round-trip properties (storage/retrieval, request ID preservation)
- Metamorphic properties (tracing doesn't change operation results)
- Error condition properties (failures still create spans)

### Test Data Generation

For property-based tests, we will generate:
- Random addresses for actors, attestors, and anchors
- Random timestamps within valid ranges
- Random payload hashes
- Random asset names and amounts
- Random ledger states (sequence numbers, timestamps)

### Validation Approach

Each property test will:
1. Generate random test inputs
2. Execute the operation with tracing enabled
3. Retrieve the tracing span
4. Assert the property holds
5. Repeat for minimum 100 iterations

Each unit test will:
1. Set up specific test scenario
2. Execute the operation
3. Verify expected behavior
4. Clean up test state

## Implementation Notes

- Tests will use `Env::default()` for test environment setup
- Tests will use `env.mock_all_auths()` to bypass authentication for test scenarios
- Tests will use `env.ledger().with_mut()` to manipulate ledger state for uniqueness testing
- Tests will use existing test utilities from `src/request_id_tests.rs` as reference
- All tests will be added to new test modules to avoid modifying existing test files
- Tests will verify behavior without modifying the implementation code
